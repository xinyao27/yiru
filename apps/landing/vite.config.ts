/**
 * Why: the router owns the document (src/shell.tsx), so the dev server has to render
 * it the same way the build does — a static index.html cannot carry the dehydrated
 * payload `RouterClient` reads, and hydrating against one renders Not Found.
 *
 * This is a `transformIndexHtml` hook rather than a middleware on purpose. A
 * middleware registered through `configureServer` never receives the request on this
 * repo's Vite 8 toolchain — verified by instrumenting it: the plugin loads,
 * `configureServer` runs, the handler is never called. That is the same symptom
 * TanStack/router#7614 reports for Start's own dev plugin, and the reason Start is not
 * an option here. `transformIndexHtml` is a first-class hook Vite calls for every HTML
 * request, so it sidesteps middleware ordering entirely: Vite hands over the shell
 * document and this replaces it wholesale with the rendered route.
