// document Vite emitted and injected into each rendered page.
//
// TanStack Start would do all of this, including a dev server that renders the same
// way. Its dev plugin is broken on this repo's Vite 8 toolchain (TanStack/router#7614,
// still open), so vite.config.ts carries a small middleware for dev and this script
// covers the build.
