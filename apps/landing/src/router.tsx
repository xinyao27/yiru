/**
 * Why: code-based routes rather than the file-based plugin. File routes buy their
 * keep at the point there are enough of them to make the boilerplate hurt; today
 * there are two, and the plugin's generated route tree is a build artifact checked
 * into source that then has to be kept current. Swapping later is contained here.
 *
 * Each route owns its own head. `head().meta` carries the title, description and the
 * og/twitter pairs, and `script:ld+json` is a first-class entry in it — so the JSON-LD
 * comes from the same data the page renders, through the same mechanism, rather than
 * being injected into the HTML afterwards by the build.
