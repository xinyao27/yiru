/**
 * Why: the prose lives here rather than on the homepage, which stays the size of a
 * business card on purpose. The capability sections come first because they say
 * what the product is; the questions answer what is left over.
 *
 * Each question is a heading rather than a `dt`, which reads better to a search
 * engine — the question text is the query — and is the only valid option: `dt`
 * forbids heading descendants, so a `dl` cannot carry them.
