 * Why: the root route's `shellComponent`, which makes the router the owner of the
 * whole document rather than of a div inside one. That is the shape TanStack Router
 * documents — the client entry hydrates `document` — and it is what lets its
 * dehydration protocol line the two renders up. The previous arrangement, a Vite
 * index.html with a #root for the router to fill, could not hydrate at all: the
 * router renders one fewer Suspense boundary under the server resolve condition, so
 * React found boundary comments in the document that its client tree did not have.
 *
 * Everything else the head needs comes from the routes' own `head()` through
 * HeadContent, and `Scripts` emits the router's dehydrated payload. Vite's hashed
 * asset tags are injected around this by apps/landing/scripts/prerender.mjs, which
 * is the only thing here Vite still owns.

            Vite serves CSS through the JS module graph in dev, so the document it
            hands over has no stylesheet at all — and now that the document arrives
            with the page already rendered into it, the browser paints that content
            before main.tsx has run. `?direct` asks Vite for the compiled text rather
            than the module, which makes it a real render-blocking stylesheet. The
            import in main.tsx stays: that is what HMR listens to.
            The build has no need for this; apps/landing/scripts/prerender.mjs injects the hashed
            stylesheet right after the charset instead. */}
