# Transport invariants

## Current product boundary

- Desktop and mobile use authenticated direct `ws` / `wss` endpoints. The
  first-party Cloud Relay implementation was retired on 2026-07-24; the native client must not
  silently revive its deleted provisioning or credential lifecycle.
- Pairing continues to validate legacy relay fields because old QR payloads can still reach the
  boundary, but no relay secret is persisted and no relay connection is attempted.
- The desktop public key from the pairing offer remains pinned across every reconnect. A fresh
  ephemeral client key and nonce create a new E2EE session for every physical socket.

## Connection lifecycle

- One `RuntimeHostSession` owns each host's physical connection generation. Feature code never
  creates a WebSocket and concurrent unary calls share one authenticated peer.
- Reconnect delays are 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 30, and 60 seconds, capped at 12
  fast attempts, followed by one 90-second trickle attempt until recovery.
- Three consecutive explicit E2EE authentication rejections latch `authenticationFailed`.
  Network, timeout, malformed-frame, and protocol failures do not erase the saved pairing.
- Foreground activation and offline-to-online or interface changes wake the reconnect loop.
  A live socket is pinged first so a healthy connection is not replaced unnecessarily.
- A 20-second WebSocket heartbeat with an 8-second deadline detects half-open sockets. Failure
  invalidates exactly that connection generation; stale socket callbacks cannot replace or close
  a newer generation.

## Request and cancellation behavior

- One receive loop owns the encrypted stream and dispatches oRPC responses by request ID. Feature
  calls never race each other for `URLSessionWebSocketTask.receive()`.
- View cancellation removes its pending response waiter and is not displayed as an error. It does
  not tear down a healthy shared session used by another feature.
- A transport failure invalidates the peer and starts reconnection. Unary calls are not replayed
  automatically because a mutation may already have reached the desktop; each feature chooses
  whether its operation is safe to retry.
- The shared control connection requests a short-lived terminal bulk ticket. One host-scoped
  terminal multiplexer owns the authenticated binary socket, epoch, heartbeat, correlation IDs,
  and route allocation. Concurrent terminal sessions share it; closing one session releases only
  its route, while closing the final route closes the idle bulk connection. Renderer and feature
  code never read either socket.

## Persistence and diagnostics

- Host metadata lives in app storage; device tokens remain in this-device-only Keychain storage.
- Connection snapshots are value types. Platform actors publish them upward but do not own SwiftUI
  presentation state.
- User-visible phases distinguish connecting, reconnecting, unreachable, and authentication
  failure so recovery does not collapse into a generic offline label.
