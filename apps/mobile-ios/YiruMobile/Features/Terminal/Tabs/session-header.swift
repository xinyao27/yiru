            // Middle truncation yields `we…hitecture-gap` instead of dropping the suffix, which
            // is the half that identifies the workspace.

            // Why: the title occupies the center area between the 44pt back hit target and the
            // trailing menu. A 220pt principal slot leaves room for the repository prefix while
            // letting the navigation bar own the hard edge constraints on the smallest device;
            // stated explicitly so a long workspace name cannot swallow the title margins.
