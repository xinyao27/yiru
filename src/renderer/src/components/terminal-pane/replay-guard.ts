// Why: xterm.js auto-responds to terminal query sequences (DA1 `CSI c`,
// DECRQM `CSI ? Ps $ p`, OSC 10/11 color queries, focus events, CPR) by
// emitting the reply through its onData callback. In pty-connection.ts that
// callback is wired directly to `transport.sendInput`, which pipes the reply
// to the shell's stdin. When we restore terminal state at startup or on
// reattach we write recorded PTY bytes back into xterm — including any
// queries the previous agent CLI emitted — and the auto-replies end up as
// stray characters on the new shell's prompt (e.g. `?1;2c`, `2026;2$y`,
// OSC 10/11 color fragments).
//
// xterm does not expose a `wasUserInput` flag on its public onData, so we
// cannot distinguish replay-induced replies from real keystrokes after the
// fact. Instead, we track an in-flight replay counter per pane: callers
// replay into xterm via `replayIntoTerminal`, which increments the counter,
// writes, and decrements in xterm's write-completion callback. The onData
// handler in pty-connection.ts drops data while the counter is non-zero.
//
// The guard window is bounded by xterm's own parse completion, not a
// wall-clock timer, so only replies generated while parsing the replayed
// bytes are suppressed. User keystrokes typed after the replay completes
// are unaffected. In practice replay finishes within milliseconds — before
// the user could meaningfully type — so the few-ms window where real input
// would also be dropped is acceptable relative to correctness.

export type ReplayingPanesRef = React.RefObject<Map<number, number>>

// Why stall handling exists: the decrement above only runs when xterm
// completes the write. A wedged WriteBuffer (sync throw escaping a parse
// handler or a write-completion callback — see
// xterm-write-buffer-stall.repro.test.ts) or a disposed-terminal race can
// drop that completion forever, leaving the guard latched on a live pane —
// which silently eats every keystroke (Discord #performance / issue #2836).
//
// Why release is probe-certified, never time-based: a blind timeout release
// while a slow replay is still parsing would let xterm's auto-replies leak
// into the shell — and into agent TUIs, where a leaked ESC reads as the user
// pressing Escape. Instead, when a completion looks overdue we enqueue an
// empty probe write. xterm parses writes in order, so only three states are
// possible, and release is provably safe in every state that releases:
//   1. probe completes, replay callback already ran   → normal release won.
//   2. probe completes, replay callback never ran     → every replay byte has
//      parsed (FIFO), so no further auto-replies can exist; the completion
//      was genuinely lost. Release.
//   3. probe never completes                          → wedged OR merely
//      behind. Other completions parsing after the probe was queued prove
//      "behind" — the deadline extends until a fully quiet window passes.
//      Only a quiet window certifies wedged: a dead parser can never emit
//      auto-replies, so releasing then cannot leak anything — and the pane
//      needs recovery, which the breadcrumb reports.
// While the probe is pending (slow-but-alive replay), the guard HOLDS.
