# Mobile access across networks

Yiru does not operate a relay or account service. Yiru Mobile connects directly to the Bun daemon,
and its application payload remains end-to-end encrypted. When the phone and daemon are not on the
same LAN, provide network reachability with a private overlay such as Tailscale or WireGuard.

## Tailscale

1. Install Tailscale on the daemon host and iPhone, then join both to the same tailnet.
2. Start Yiru and advertise the host's private address in the pairing offer:

   ```sh
   yiru daemon --mobile-pairing --pairing-address 100.64.0.10
   ```

3. Open the emitted `yiru://pair` link on the iPhone. For an already-running daemon, use:

   ```sh
   yiru mobile pair --address 100.64.0.10 --device-name "My iPhone"
   ```

4. Limit inbound access to the daemon port with tailnet ACLs. Do not expose it through public port
   forwarding. The E2EE pairing token authenticates the mobile transport; network membership alone
   is not authentication.

Use the actual Tailscale address or MagicDNS name visible to the phone. Re-pair after intentionally
rotating the daemon's mobile key or deleting the paired device.

Do not add `--listen 0.0.0.0`: that option exposes the Chrome extension RPC listener and is not
needed for mobile access. The mobile listener binds independently and requires its E2EE device
credential.

## WireGuard

Put the daemon host and iPhone in the same WireGuard network, allow only the Yiru mobile port between
their private addresses, then use the daemon host's WireGuard address in the same commands above.
Keep peer keys and configuration outside the repository. If the overlay changes the host address,
issue a new pairing link so the offer contains the reachable address.

## Background notifications

An overlay network does not wake a suspended iOS app. Background alerts use the stateless APNs
gateway in `apps/apns-gateway`; the gateway stores nothing and sees only an opaque encrypted payload.
Configure its four Cloudflare secrets as documented in
[`apps/apns-gateway/README.md`](../../apps/apns-gateway/README.md), then set these service environment
variables on the daemon host:

```text
YIRU_APNS_GATEWAY_URL=https://<worker-host>/v1/push
YIRU_APNS_GATEWAY_TOKEN=<same value as GATEWAY_SHARED_SECRET>
```

Restart the daemon after changing its service environment. Yiru requests notification permission in
context on iOS, registers the APNs device token only after pairing, suppresses APNs while that device
has a live socket, and decrypts notification details locally in its Notification Service Extension.

Production and sandbox APNs tokens are not interchangeable. Use separate Worker deployments and
the matching iOS signing environment. A complete release check still requires a physical device:
background the app, let an agent reach `waiting-decision` or `complete`, and verify both delivery and
local decryption on the lock screen.
