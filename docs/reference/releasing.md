# Releasing Yiru

Yiru releases are prepared locally and published by GitHub Actions. Local preparation owns version
alignment and deterministic Homebrew checksums; CI owns signing, notarization, registry uploads,
Chrome Web Store submission, TestFlight, and the optional APNs gateway. Release credentials stay
in GitHub and are never written into the repository.

## One-time setup

Run the interactive setup once from the repository root. It opens the provider pages that require
a human sign-in and saves the values you paste directly into GitHub repository or environment
Secrets:

```bash
pnpm release:setup
```

The setup is safe to rerun: existing Secret names are detected and their values are left unchanged.
No credential value is written into the checkout.

The release workflows require these GitHub repository secrets:

- `NPM_TOKEN` for the first `@yiru/cli` publication. Create a granular npm token with read/write
  access to the `@yiru` scope and publishing 2FA bypass. After the first release, configure npm
  Trusted Publishing for repository `xinyao27/yiru`, workflow `daemon-release.yml`, and the
  `npm publish` action; then remove the long-lived token.
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `APNS_KEY_ID`, `APNS_KEY_P8`,
  `APNS_TEAM_ID`, and `GATEWAY_SHARED_SECRET` only when deploying the optional APNs gateway.
- The Apple signing, notarization, and App Store Connect values referenced by
  `daemon-release.yml` and `mobile-release.yml`.

Create the `chrome-web-store` GitHub environment and store `CWS_CLIENT_ID`, `CWS_CLIENT_SECRET`,
`CWS_REFRESH_TOKEN`, and `CWS_PUBLISHER_ID` as environment secrets. The OAuth client must enable
the Chrome Web Store API and allow `https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground` as a redirect
URI. Generate the refresh token with the
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chromewebstore` scope.

The APNs workflow sends its four runtime secrets to Wrangler through a runner-only file and deletes
that file before the job ends. Cloudflare preserves other Worker secrets that are not included.
APNs is optional: set the repository variable `APNS_GATEWAY_ENABLED=true` only when its credentials
are configured. Otherwise the workflow validates the Worker without deploying it.

## Prepare a release

Start from a clean `main` that exactly matches `origin/main`, with Node.js 24 and Bun 1.4.0:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm release -- prepare 0.0.37
```

The command updates the workspace, daemon, extension, and npm CLI versions; builds the daemon
target matrix; writes the four Homebrew checksums; packages the Chrome extension; and runs
`pnpm check`. It deliberately does not commit or push. Review the generated release changes, commit
them, and push `main` using the commands printed at the end.

## Publish

After the release commit is present on `origin/main`, run:

```bash
pnpm release -- publish 0.0.37
```

Type the version at the confirmation gate. The command verifies credentials, creates and atomically
pushes `v0.0.37` and `extension-v0.0.37`. Those tags trigger the daemon/npm/Homebrew and Chrome
release workflows, then it starts the iOS TestFlight upload. The daemon is not a separate product
surface: it is the runtime required by the Chrome extension and paired iOS app.

Skip one target when necessary:

```bash
pnpm release -- publish 0.0.37 --skip-extension
pnpm release -- publish 0.0.37 --skip-daemon
pnpm release -- publish 0.0.37 --skip-ios
```

APNs is optional infrastructure for iPhone background notifications:

| Target | When it publishes | How to publish |
| --- | --- | --- |
| APNs | `apps/apns-gateway` or its dependency graph changes on `main` and the gateway is enabled | Automatic, or manually run `APNs Gateway` |

The conductor can select the TestFlight audience and optionally redeploy APNs:

```bash
pnpm release -- publish 0.0.37 --ios-distribution external \
  --ios-changelog 'Faster connections and lower resource usage.'
pnpm release -- publish 0.0.37 --with-apns
```

If a tag already exists at the current release commit, the command dispatches its workflow again
instead of recreating the tag. Registry publication is also idempotent: an existing npm version is
reported and skipped.

Follow the latest workflow runs with:

```bash
pnpm release -- status 0.0.37
```
