// Why: lanes paint from the design system's own graph tokens rather than
// vscode-git-graph's 12 upstream hexes, which were tuned for that extension's
// dark webview and read as neon against our surfaces. These are the same ids
// the ref badges resolve, so a branch's pill and its lane match, and `var()`
// lets the light/dark values in main.css switch without a JS theme lookup.
// Lane 0 is the ref colour: it is the trunk the checked-out branch sits on.
